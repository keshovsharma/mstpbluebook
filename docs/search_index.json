["index.html", "Example MSTP Blue Book Preface", " Example MSTP Blue Book Preface The URMC MSTP “Bluebook” (or whatever name we feel appropriate) would be a collection of basic infomration, advice, and wisdom relevant to each step of the MSTP processess, made by students of the program, to help our students maximize opportunities and minimize pitfalls across their training. The basic structure of the book contains two major parts. The first part, which is a single chapter, are called “Short Sheets”. These are collections of bullet points/checklists of things the editors of this book believe that MTSPers should attend to at that time in their career. The subsequent chapers (Early Medical Years, Pre-Qualification, etc.) are chapters that contain extended length information about topics that are pertinent to our program and advice aggregated from our seniors. Please note, this book was created from a template and is not remotely close to a complete form The current form of the book was created using bookdown for R. While a little cumbersom for those who are used to strictly using Microsoft Word, bookdown allows for creation of a website based book (here), ebooks for readers, and PDF via LaTeX that would provide the same set of information in multiple formats from a source buid. For an example of what is possible with the bookdown package in R, please see a more comprehsive build of a book provided by the creators of bookdown. "],

Many students in our program consider buying a house. If you are, it is worth looking at that section in this book. Decide on a summer rotation: Rotations in the summer before entering medical school may or may not be the right choice, depending on your circumstances and goals. Things to Remember The medical school requires that you have a car. Think about setting up an account with a bank that is close to the hospital See Banking in the Student-To-Student guide What if? I can’t find housing!: contact an editor of this book, we can put you up in a basement for some time! "],
