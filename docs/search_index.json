["short-sheets.html", "Short Sheets", " Short Sheets The following sections contain “Short Sheets”, which are bullet pointed lists with links to more comprehensive information. The impetus for these “Short Sheets” came from wanting to find a way to present the right information to our students, at the right time in their career. Instead of simply creating another collection of dense information, the “Short Sheets” are essentially checklists (inspired, in-part, by the Checklist Manifesto) that also link to more dense information. If you can safely “check off” a bullet point, saying to yourself done that or I know about that, then feel free to move past that point. If you’d like our peer input on that bullet point, read it fully and follow the links as way to get started. Remember to make time and check back for the Short Sheet most relevant to your current stage of training. Also, be mindful that not all the information in the book is linked up to a bullet point somewhere (esspecially information in the appendicies)! "],
