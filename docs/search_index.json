["index.html", "UofR MSTP Bluebook Preface", " UofR MSTP Bluebook Students of the MD-PhD Program 2020-03-08 Preface The URMC MSTP “Bluebook” is a collection of basic information, advice, and wisdom relevant to each step of the MD-PhD training process. It is made by students of the program, to help us maximize opportunities and minimize pitfalls across our training. This document was born from the need for information about the best practices of training to be aggregated in one place, instead of dispersed across multiple medical, graduate, and MSTP specific documents, emails, and presentations. The basic structure of the book contains three major parts. The first part, is a single chapter, are called “Short Sheets”. These are collections of bullet points/checklists with internal and external links to information that our students of this book believe is important for that specific phase of training. The chapters the refer to a time period (Early Medical Years, Pre-Qualification, etc.) contain extended length sections about topics that are pertinent to our program and advice aggregated from our seniors. These are longer form reading for those that are curious to know more or get broader points of view on certain topics. The chapter, title “Special Topics”, is a collection of sections that are pertinent to all phases training. There isn’t a best time to read these sections apart from the time at which they become relevant to your life. The current form of the book was created using bookdown for R. While this format is slightly cumbersome for those who are used to using Microsoft Word, bookdown allows for the simultaneous creation of a website based book (here), an ebook, and PDF book that provides the same set of information in multiple formats that allow protability to what every format you would like to read in. Additionaly, while editors are generally repsonsible for changing aspects of this book, anyone with a Github account can submit changes for direct review. For an example of what is possible with the bookdown package in R, please see a more comprehensive build of a book provided by the creators of bookdown. "],

We really mean it! Feel free to forward any suggestions, minor edits, long emails that you have sent to a friend that might be of use, or ask for a personal chat. Our editors are happy to work with whatever form of advice you have and integrate it into the blue book. Another method that we are piloting for discussion and editing is using Hypothes.is. This tool allows for highlighting and annotation of any webpage on the internet. Basically, you create an account and have a browser plug-in. From there you can highlight and comment on anything you see on the web. If other people in the groups that your account participate in have done the same, you will see that on the page. This is a link to the Hypothes.is group for the MSTP.Please join after setting up your account, if you want to use this as an editing mechanism. Email the editors if you run into any trouble. You can also have a look at our current initiatives to see if there are topics that we are working on, that you would like to contribute to.

["short-sheets.html", "Short Sheets", " Short Sheets The following sections contain “Short Sheets”, which are bullet pointed lists with links to more comprehensive information. The impetus for these “Short Sheets” came from wanting to find a way to present the right information to our students, at the right time in their career. Instead of simply creating another collection of dense information, the “Short Sheets” are essentially checklists (inspired, in-part, by the Checklist Manifesto) that also link to more dense information. If you can safely “check off” a bullet point, saying to yourself done that or I know about that, then feel free to move past that point. If you’d like our peer input on that bullet point, read it fully and follow the links as way to get started. Remember to make time and check back for the Short Sheet most relevant to your current stage of training. Also, be mindful that not all the information in the book is linked up to a bullet point somewhere (esspecially information in the appendicies)! "],

Highlighted here are resources for aspects of the transition that people usually need help with and do not always have a guide for. Things to Do Find a place to live: The Medical School’s Student-To-Student Guide p. 34 has a fantastic section detailing housing. Also, read our quick blurb on a general format for finding a place to live. Decide on a summer rotation: Rotations in the summer before entering medical school are optional (paragraph 1). Read our section on what to consider for an incoming rotation if you would like our peer perspective on this choice. Get an understanding of how taxes work as a graduate or MSTP student at URMC. Particularly, it is important to understand whether you will need to save a portion of your paychecks to pay extra taxes at the end of your transition year. Also, the Graduate School maintains a page of information on Graduate Student Taxes with Powerpoints and PDF examples of forms that you can learn from. Things to Consider Read the description of Year One in the MSTP student handbook to get a general sense of what is coming at you this year. You will want to plan to move in earlier than the weekend before medical school orientation. The MSTP program typically has a picinc and retreat on Thursday and Friday before 1st years start. The 2019 MSTP Picnic is on Thursday, August 8th after work at the Hawthorne Shelter in GVP.

["transitioning-to-rochester.html", "Transitioning to Rochester", " Transitioning to Rochester Very general guidance on finding a place to live Author: Keshov K. Sharma Being a medical student requires a workflow that demands a lot of your time and energy. As such, even generally short commutes or coordinating a complex parking situation can become a thorn in your side on heavy studying days. Being able to sleep in a bit or walk to the library can really make a difference when you’re pulling long days. Because of this, it is generally recommended that incoming students find a place close to the University for the first year in the program. Since you’ll be spending 7-9 years here, using the first year to hammer down your medical school workflow and get a feel for Rochester is a good investment of your time. For single people, this tends to manifest as getting a room/splitting a house in the White Coat area or getting a room in Goler House. For couples, getting an apartment at University Apartments or one of the many apartment complexes nearby is a solid choice. One “transitional” year can really pay off in the long run. Even if you end up wanting to move farther from the University, the one year spent getting your footing and exploring the variety of neighborhoods in Rochester allows you to get the most out of your housing situation in the back 6-8 years without putting to much stress on you at the transition point. To do or not to do; an incoming rotation… Author: Keshov K. Sharma This is an age old question that many a-incoming MSTPer struggles with. For most, it is a battle within one’s self that hinges upon a much simpler, practical question: Do I keep working, or do I take a break? Realistically, only you can answer this question for yourself; however, there are a few key points that you should consider when making this decision. The rotation is truly optional Seriously, check it. It is optional from a policy stand-point. It is optional from a social stand-point. Many of our students do this rotation and many do not, but the unifying factor is that we all understand that it is a personal choice. It will only impact your career here if you want it to There are plenty of students who pass on this rotation. At our regular end-of-the-year panel discussion, where our graduating students pass down wisdom to our younger years, no one (in recent memory) has cited their incoming rotation as a particularly pertinent element of their career. That being said, there are plenty of students that have used this first rotation to get a jump on their research, especially when they rotated with a PI that they have a pre-established relationship with. While medical school typically consumes most of your time, there have been students who engaged with research during the medical school years and felt that they really benefitted from this. The bottom line is that this rotation could help you advance your research interests if you invest in that, but skipping is not a hindrance to your training. You get paid while you are here This is as straightforward as can be; you’re starting your job training earlier and you’re getting paid earlier. If ever there was a clearer reason to work instead of take a break, it is this one. The incoming summer is one of the last true breaks for a long time Especially for those transitioning directly from a college or masters program, the time between graduating and starting your medical training is too short to start up new projects but long enough to have a lot of fun. For most, this period of time represents one of the last, if not the last time, that you spend more than a few weeks away from all the projects, studying, writing, etc. that comes with the dual career. You will be required to do a rotation between the M1 and M2 summer. M2 summer will have you invested in STEP studying and then you join another rotation or rejoin your lab. In graduate school, there is always another paper to read, manuscript to revise, abstract to write, or emails to send. M3 and M4 won’t respect any sense of summer boundaries. This is not to say that you won’t find time for a vacation, but few people have ever found a 2+ month period where they were not beholden to career commitments during their MSTP training. Many students choose to do some traveling, see family, and/or take time with a significant other during this time. A general recommendation Returning to our simplified question, do I keep working, or do I take a break?, one can only make a solid recommendation to those on the extreme ends: If you are a current college senior, having interviewed while finishing college, the general recommendation from almost all of your peers is that you take the summer off before starting medical school. If you ended a job early, got your share of travel/seeing family well before school starts, and don’t have much else to do - get moving on a rotation! Beyond these scenarios, you’ll get a mix of advice and you will have to figure out what is applicable to you. You should always feel free to contact any of our MSTP students for advice or input - an editor of this book would happily speak with you if you reached out. If you find yourself truly unable to decide, flip a coin. If you don’t the result, pretend it landed on the other side. "],
["advice-for-courses.html", "Advice for Courses", " Advice for Courses HSF Authors: Keshov K. Sharma, Alison Livada, and the MSTP Class of 2026 The Medical School’s Student-To-Student Guide p. 8 has great information about specific details about the Human Structure Function (HSF) course. Everything from textbook recommendations to a subject-by-subject breakdown of study strategy is present here. It is highly recommended that you at least skim this section to understand what advice you could read, should you need some specific input. Here, our MSTP students would like to express their general advice about approaching HSF. Get your life together before starting HSF: Thanks to some recent curricular changes, 1st year medical students start their career here in arguably the most demanding course URMC has to offer. As such, it’s pretty imperative that first years quickly develop a routine that can keep them afloat. Ideally, in the few weeks before starting HSF, an incoming student should get into a routine where they are working 10 hours/day for 5-6 days a week, awake and active during from 8am-5pm every day, with your workouts, sleeping, cooking, etc. happening outside the 8am-5pm spot. This does not mean that every day, or every week of HSF, will be like this. However, getting yourself adapted prior to entering HSF will allow you to quickly find the right routine for you without falling behind on work (e.g. sleeping through early lectures or not having enough energy to stay attentive through the day early on). Be immersed in HSF: HSF is an intense course for students and teachers. Some people have estimated that it is, within itself, enough credit hours for the average college major. It is a crowning course of this institution and many regard it as the hardest thing that you will do at Rochester. This course is where you learn human physiology in amazing depth. It is very demanding but incredibly rewarding if you pay attention and learn as much as you can. What you learn in this course forms the foundation for all the other knowledge you take in during medical school. Literally, everything you study for this course has the potential to benefit a patient you will see in the future. So when you’re sitting there, racking your brain, asking yourself why you need to know such minutia, please trust that it will be worth it down the line. A number of people make HSF harder for themselves by thinking “is this what medical school will always be like?”, “will I always be this tired?”, or “will I ever get time for my hobbies or interests again?”. The answers are “no”, “no”, and “yes”, respectively. Try to put those worries out of your mind and trust that the most efficient, time-tested way to get all this information in your head is to cut out a few months and really focus. Additionally, this is one of the few times in your life where you will have so many dedicated teachers at your disposal, ready to help you learn as much as you can. As such, use this period of time as an incredibly privileged learning opportunity and trust that life will balance out afterward. Try hard, but don’t be hard on yourself: Your first two years of medical school are indeed pass/fail. However, our older students would like to emphasize that HSF too is pass/fail. Given that this is the first course, it can be challenging to adopt the pass/fail perspective after whatever your rigorous journey was to medical school. We believe that focusing on passing and being comfortable with not knowing all the material will be a useful tool in maintaining physical and mental wellness in the context of a long MSTP program. Some of your MD peers might be focusing on top 10 percent or acing STEP already during the first year in preparation for competitive residency applications. As MSTP students, the PhD puts more time between your pre-clinical years and your residency applications, giving you time to develop and bring your unique assets to the residency process. As such, pushing yourself too hard, early on in your journey is likely to hurt more than it will help. You will be challenged throughout the MSTP and there is no need to set a higher bar for yourself, as some of us may be want to do. SRM MMI MTC Host Defense Pharmacology MBB DPT "],

Some of our students, when submitting proposals that include a 5 year PhD training time, have come across stubling block in the review process where by their Program Officer will inform them that they need refersher training for RCR that is compatible with NOT-OD-10-019 Guidlines. For example, one might get a phrase in an email like: “NIH requires that instruction must be undertaken at least once during each career stage, and at a frequency of no less than once every four years. This means that you are due for refresher training during the proposed project period.” Our general understanding is of these guidlines, gleaned through some student experience, is that after your initial RCR training in the first year of Graduate School, you are required to do a series of activities to continue your education in RCR such that every four years, you meet the requirements set forth in these guidelines. Some programs have all their 5+ year PhD students re-take the RCR course. We have found that Program Officers are willing to accept a table of continuing RCR activites that you have done or plan to do over the next 5 years that meet the requirements. It is recommended that you speak email Dr. O’Banion if this issue comes up. Additionally, if you choose to make a custom RCR plan (often the easier and more desireable route), be sure to have your Program Officer look it over before it is formally sent into the NIH. Finally, if you need an example for a customized plan and how it was presented, please feel free to contact Keshov K. Sharma. "],

["taxes.html", "Taxes", " Taxes Authors: Keshov K. Sharma and Colleen Schneider Taxes, in general… The guiding principle of taxation is that the government takes a portion of your income in order to fund the nation and its associated services (police, EMTs, etc.). In a “typical” job, your employer is responsible taking a portion of each of your paychecks and paying taxes on your behalf throughout the year (i.e. withholding income). The amount you earned from an employer and the amount withheld for a given year is reported to you and the government on a W-2 form. For people who have a job that issues a W-2 and that job is their only source of income, the process of paying taxes is essentially checking to make sure that your tax bill is paid in full from the money that was already withheld and asking for a tax refund if more money was paid than necessary. Taxes At University of Rochester are a “Fellowship” - not a W-2 For complicated reasons related to the nuances of tax law1, money given to students with scholarship stipends at the university (MSTP students, graduate students, etc.) is classified as “fellowship income”. With fellowship income, you don’t have a W-2 and you’re not formally recognized as an employee, which means that withholding is not done for you by default and YOU WILL HAVE TO DO THIS YOURSELF. Hence, you are given your full check every two weeks (without money taken out and given to the government) and expected to calculate and pay your own tax bill. At the end of the year, you will be given a letter that states how much stipend money was disbursed to you, which will help you calculate what your income was for the year. For most MSTP students, this is their only source of income and it constitutes the entirety of the Adjusted Gross Income. Again, because you’re not a W-2 employee, you’re expected to make payments towards your tax bill in advance or throughout the year (i.e. estimated tax payments). In nutshell, the payment of estimated taxes requires you to make a good faith estimate of your tax bill for the upcoming year and pay 90% of that bill in advance. You can pay that estimated tax bill as a single lump payment when doing your taxes for the previous year (in April) or in four quarterly payments across the year. Calculating your estimated taxes will require that you use Federal Form 1040-ES and NYS Form IT-2105-I and the process is basically the process of calculating your tax bill. Hence, it is recommneded that you calculate your estimated tax payments for the upcoming year each time you sit down to do your taxes for the previous year. These forms can be a little technically dense, but contain all the information you would need and payments can be made instantaneously using online portals. This tax “stuff” is not intuitive, so if you have questions or need help, be sure to contact Alysha Taggart, a Blue Book Editor, or get help from UMRC’s Graduate Student Society, which maintains a page of information on Graduate Student Taxes. A Simple Approach to Estimated Tax Payments Based on current Federal and NYS Tax Brackets, I have personally found that cutting out $175 from each paycheck and putting it in a separate savings account is sufficient to cover my tax bills. Basically, I set up a separate account (savings, for the higher percentage) at my bank and automatically transfer $175 from each paycheck to the account. I estimate my tax bill each season (using those sheets) and pay my estimated tax payments to the Fed and NYS each quarter. Over the years, this account has generally grown every so slightly, which means I could probably reduce the $175 to $150. However, given the laundry list of things that we need to save for, it doesn’t hurt to stash some extra cash away. If you’re looking set up a bank account with a branch that is physically accessible to the medical center, the URMC Student-To-Student Guide has section on local banks on page 49. Filing Taxes Please be aware that turbotax is free (any level of the software including submitting to multiple states, so even those with complicated tax situations can capitlize on this offer) to anyone who makes less than $34,000 per year under the free file program (other software is available for free if you make less than $66,000), but you have to go through a side webpage to access this free offer because Turbo Tax doesn’t want you to know about it and click the see if you qualify button to start. Do this at the beginning of filing because if you enter things in other versions of turbo tax they won’t transfer to Turbo Tax Freedom. In general you want to use Turbo Tax Freedom and not Turbo Tax Free File, because the latter is not actually free if you have a complicated tax situation but the former is. The correct place to enter fellowship income, per IRS, and per prompts in TurboTax (ff your lucky to hit the prompt), is in the Wages, Salaries, &amp; Tips Worksheet. You will need to locate that worksheet in the forms area in TurboTax. Enter it in the Scholarship line: Line 13. The system will then automatically put in on 1040 line 7, and add SCH as the prefix. It seems that Turbo Tax does not have the option to enter it in via the step-by-step area. The Incoming Hiccup In your first year, you may transition from W-2 income at a previous job to fellowship income. Thus, you will need to save the right amount of money from your stipend paychecks yourself, then pay it as part of your tax bill for that year. This means that you will probably take 10-15%2 of every stipend check and put that in a private savings account. When you do your taxes for the year in which you transitioned to medical school, you’ll probably need to pay more than what was already withheld on your behalf because withholding was not done for your fall income. To illustrate such a situation, let’s say that you had a W-2 job for six months, where you made $30,000. The next six months, you made roughly $15,000 in scholarship income at the MSTP. Of the $30,000 that you made, a certain amount was withheld already and it’s been handed over the government. From the $15,000 that you made, nothing was withheld. And so, from your stipend checks, you should put away 15% and be ready to pay that in taxes. When tax season comes around, you will calculate your tax bill using an Adjusted Gross Income of $45,000 and subtract the money that was withheld already from the final bill. Because that withholding was only done for $30,000 out of your $45,000 total income, you will likely have a balance left to pay to the government. If you diverted 15% of your paychecks, then you should be able to pay that balance. For most people, the $175 out of every paycheck suggested above should work just fine, assuming your Adjusted Gross Income is between $25,000 and $60,000. Thanks to new tax laws stipulating taxes on “fringe benefits” for jobs, the amount that a university pays in scholarships for employees is considered taxable income beyond ~$5,000 per year. This means that, if graduate students were considered to be employees, it is very possible that they would be taxed at the $80,000 income level, because the ~$50,000 tuition waiver would be considered a “fringe benefit”. The move away from a W-2 thus fully shields graduate students from this (and probably still benefits the university, somehow).↩ This number is recommended based on the tax bracket that MSTP students are typically within. This might be higher or lower, depending on the amount of money you made in a job prior to entering the program. For example, someone transitioning from a $100,000/year job in the fall has probably already made enough money to be taxed at a higher rate. Accordingly, someone who did not work a job before the fall will probably not make enough money that year to qualify for any taxation at all. Check federal and state tax brackets for more information on this.↩ "],

It details the current goals and subproject that the editors are currently working on. It also describes the basic organization for oversight of this book and the workflows used by editors to produce content. Current Initiatives Finalize Advice Sections for M1 and M2 classes. We would like to have short advice sections for M1 and M2 classes. This is mostly to cover aspects of advice that are not already addressed in the URMC Student to Student Guide. We invite ANY input for these topics and you can see the blank headings within the book. Develop content for Pre-Qual Graduate School. Content around transitions, doing so smoothly, and adressing MSTP specific topics is lacking in this book and in many other places. Right now, the following articles are lined up for pre-qual graduate school and are currently being worked on: Finding a Mentor (Uday and Keshov) Concise Approach to Writing and F30 (Annette and Keshov) Approach to Longitondal Clerkships (Keshov) Writing About Topics that Span Years. We need some more people to pick up topics that across years, like buying a house, etc. Workflow Background Info We use bookdown to produce this book, in its various forms, from Rmarkdown (.Rmd) files. The basic process is that Rmarkdown files (written using the Markdown syntax) are automatically compiled into an HTML website that is paginated like a book as well as an .Epub and PDF version of the book that can be downloaded from the website. Each of the chapters (except the Preface which is part of index.rmd) exists as an independent .Rmd with a number before the chapter to designate it’s order in the book. As such, level 1 headings designate a chapter and level 2 headings designate an article under a chapter. This last point is critical for content production. When new content is produced using Microsoft Word or plain text, it THE HIGHEST HEADING LEVEL SHOULD BE LEVEL 2. This ensures that when the content is converted to Markdown and pasted into the .rmd file, it shows up as an article under the correct chapter instead of a new chapter in the book. Any subheadings should be at level 3 or more to show up within the article. Pages are split at the level 1 and level 2 headings. Process of editing In a nutshell, when not simply editing the plain text of an .Rmd file for minor errors, editors will: convert a Word document of content to Markdown paste this into the correct chapter ensure links and references render correctly make sure links line up (cross-linking, etc.) ensure that the website render’s correctly push edits to the master branch It is the job of the chump-in-charge “senior” editor to review all pushes to the master branch and get approval for their integration from Alysha Taggart before accepting them. In the future, we are planning on having Alysha either create her own Github account to be the final check on this procees. Alternatively, the book in a more finalized form can be ported to the MSTP website. This is an ongoing conversation that we re-develop around May 2020. Required R Packages and System Set-Ups Install RStudio and Rmarkdown Ensure that you can use Github through RStudio or the command line. Download and install Pandoc which is a background utility used for converting between Markdown and other formats. Install Bookdown (preferably thorugh RStudio) Install DiagrammR (preferably through RStudio) Authorship As we are a bunch of academics, we technically have to provide some authorship guidelines for written work… right? Thus, the general authorship policy is as follows: Authorship is offered at the Heading 3 level for the chapters “Early Medical Years” through “Special Topics”, such that an author or authors are credited with the contents of everything under that heading. This basically means that people get credit for an “article” written under a “section” and “chapter” but we’re only crediting the chapters that contain comprehensive writing (i.e. no authorship for bullet points on a Short Sheet) Authorship is depicted with the authors name displayed in their choice of style with a hyperlink to a legitimate method of contact. Usually, this would look something like Keshov K. Sharma with the link opening to an email to the author. Twitter/Facebook links or links to Contact Me pages on a personal website are also acceptable. Authorship from a group of people is also acceptable, as long as there is at least one person who can be contacted. As such, “by The MSTP Class of 2023” with the hyperlink pointing to Keshov K. Sharma’s email is acceptable. Authorship should be granted to anyone who wrote a sizable portion of the current body text or significantly contributed to the formation of the current body text; but not to those who provided edits, suggestions, or minor corrections. If anyone really cares, authors should be lised in order of most contribution to least and, if need be, authorship and amount of contribution is decided by editors not involved in the authorship process of a particular contriubtion. As such, when articles have been significantly revised by future years, original authors can be dropped by editors to make space for those making more recent, sizable contributions to the current form of the book. Authors have the option of switching between a credited and anonamymous contribution at any time. "],
