Sharma The purpose of this article is to log solutions to unqiue but not uncommon problems that our students have encountered during the F30 submission process. Ideally, each problem has a short background and a detail of the steps taken to mitigate the issue. Please feel free to submit your experiences to the “Author”, who is really tasked with keeping this article up to date. “Refresher” Training in Responsible Conduct of Research Needed for 5+ year PhDs: NOT-OD-10-019 Guidelines. Some of our students, when submitting proposals that include a 5 year PhD training time, have come across stubling block in the review process where by their Program Officer will inform them that they need refersher training for RCR that is compatible with NOT-OD-10-019 Guidlines. For example, one might get a phrase in an email like: “NIH requires that instruction must be undertaken at least once during each career stage, and at a frequency of no less than once every four years. This means that you are due for refresher training during the proposed project period.” Our general understanding is of these guidlines, gleaned through some student experience, is that after your initial RCR training in the first year of Graduate School, you are required to do a series of activities to continue your education in RCR such that every four years, you meet the requirements set forth in these guidelines. Some programs have all their 5+ year PhD students re-take the RCR course. We have found that Program Officers are willing to accept a table of continuing RCR activites that you have done or plan to do over the next 5 years that meet the requirements. It is recommended that you speak email Dr. O’Banion if this issue comes up. Additionally, if you choose to make a custom RCR plan (often the easier and more desireable route), be sure to have your Program Officer look it over before it is formally sent into the NIH. Finally, if you need an example for a customized plan and how it was presented, please feel free to contact Keshov K. Sharma. "]
