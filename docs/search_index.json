["index.html", "UofR MSTP Bluebook Preface", " UofR MSTP Bluebook Students of the MD-PhD Program 2019-05-28 Preface The URMC MSTP “Bluebook” is a collection of basic information, advice, and wisdom relevant to each step of the MD-PhD training process. It is made by students of the program, to help us maximize opportunities and minimize pitfalls across our training. This document was born from the need for information about the best practices of training to be aggregated in one place, instead of dispersed across multiple medical, graduate, and MSTP specific documents, emails, and presentations. The basic structure of the book contains three major parts. The first part, is a single chapter, are called “Short Sheets”. These are collections of bullet points/checklists with internal and external links to information that our students of this book believe is important for that specific phase of training. The chapters the refer to a time period (Early Medical Years, Pre-Qualification, etc.) contain extended length sections about topics that are pertinent to our program and advice aggregated from our seniors. These are longer form reading for those that are curious to know more or get broader points of view on certain topics. The chapter, title “Special Topics”, is a collection of sections that are pertinent to all phases training. There isn’t a best time to read these sections apart from the time at which they become relevant to your life. The current form of the book was created using bookdown for R. While this format is slightly cumbersome for those who are used to using Microsoft Word, bookdown allows for the simultaneous creation of a website based book (here), an ebook, and PDF book that provides the same set of information in multiple formats that allow protability to what every format you would like to read in. Additionaly, while editors are generally repsonsible for changing aspects of this book, anyone with a Github account can submit changes for direct review. For an example of what is possible with the bookdown package in R, please see a more comprehensive build of a book provided by the creators of bookdown. "],

["short-sheets.html", "Short Sheets", " Short Sheets The following sections contain “Short Sheets”, which are bullet pointed lists with links to more comprehensive information. The impetus for these “Short Sheets” came from wanting to find a way to present the right information to our students, at the right time in their career. Instead of simply creating another collection of dense information, the “Short Sheets” are essentially checklists (inspired, in-part, by the Checklist Manifesto) that also link to more dense information. If you can safely “check off” a bullet point, saying to yourself done that or I know about that, then feel free to move past that point. If you’d like our peer input on that bullet point, read it fully and follow the links as way to get started. Remember to make time and check back for the Short Sheet most relevant to your current stage of training. Also, be mindful that not all the information in the book is linked up to a bullet point somewhere (esspecially information in the appendicies)! "],

For the most part, the medical school and MSTP program will guide you through this process. Highlighted here are resources for aspects of the transition that people usually need help with and do not always have a guide for. Things to Do Find a place to live: The Medical School’s Student-To-Student Guide p. 34 has a fantastic section detailing housing. Also, read our quick blurb on a general format for finding a place to live. Decide on a summer rotation: Rotations in the summer before entering medical school are optional (paragraph 1). Read our section on what to consider for an incoming rotation if you would like our peer perspective on this choice.

["transitioning-to-rochester.html", "Transitioning to Rochester", " Transitioning to Rochester Very general guidance on finding a place to live Author: Keshov K. Sharma Being a medical student requires a workflow that demands a lot of your time and energy. As such, even generally short commutes or coordinating a complex parking situation can become a thorn in your side on heavy studying days. Being able to sleep in a bit or walk to the library can really make a difference when you’re pulling long days. Because of this, it is generally recommended that incoming students find a place close to the University for the first year in the program. Since you’ll be spending 7-9 years here, using the first year to hammer down your medical school workflow and get a feel for Rochester is a good investment of your time. For single people, this tends to manifest as getting a room/splitting a house in the White Coat area or getting a room in Goler House. For couples, getting an apartment at University Apartments or one of the many apartment complexes nearby is a solid choice. One “transitional” year can really pay off in the long run. Even if you end up wanting to move farther from the University, the one year spent getting your footing and exploring the variety of neighborhoods in Rochester allows you to get the most out of your housing situation in the back 6-8 years without putting to much stress on you at the transition point. To do or not to do; an incoming rotation… Author: Keshov K. Sharma This is an age old question that many a-incoming MSTPer struggles with. For most, it is a battle within one’s self that hinges upon a much simpler, practical question: Do I keep working, or do I take a break? Realistically, only you can answer this question for yourself; however, there are a few key points that you should consider when making this decision. The rotation is truly optional Seriously, check it. It is optional from a policy stand-point. It is optional from a social stand-point. Many of our students do this rotation and many do not, but the unifying factor is that we all understand that it is a personal choice. It will only impact your career here if you want it to There are plenty of students who pass on this rotation. At our regular end-of-the-year panel discussion, where our graduating students pass down wisdom to our younger years, no one (in recent memory) has cited their incoming rotation as a particularly pertinent element of their career. That being said, there are plenty of students that have used this first rotation to get a jump on their research, especially when they rotated with a PI that they have a pre-established relationship with. While medical school typically consumes most of your time, there have been students who engaged with research during the medical school years and felt that they really benefitted from this. The bottom line is that this rotation could help you advance your research interests if you invest in that, but skipping is not a hindrance to your training. You get paid while you are here This is as straightforward as can be; you’re starting your job training earlier and you’re getting paid earlier. If ever there was a clearer reason to work instead of take a break, it is this one. The incoming summer is one of the last true breaks for a long time Especially for those transitioning directly from a college or masters program, the time between graduating and starting your medical training is too short to start up new projects but long enough to have a lot of fun. For most, this period of time represents one of the last, if not the last time, that you spend more than a few weeks away from all the projects, studying, writing, etc. that comes with the dual career. You will be required to do a rotation between the M1 and M2 summer. M2 summer will have you invested in STEP studying and then you join another rotation or rejoin your lab. In graduate school, there is always another paper to read, manuscript to revise, abstract to write, or emails to send. M3 and M4 won’t respect any sense of summer boundaries. This is not to say that you won’t find time for a vacation, but few people have ever found a 2+ month period where they were not beholden to career commitments during their MSTP training. Many students choose to do some traveling, see family, and/or take time with a significant other during this time. A general recommendation Returning to our simplified question, do I keep working, or do I take a break?, one can only make a solid recommendation to those on the extreme ends: If you are a current college senior, having interviewed while finishing college, the general recommendation from almost all of your peers is that you take the summer off before starting medical school. If you ended a job early, got your share of travel/seeing family well before school starts, and don’t have much else to do - get moving on a rotation! Beyond these scenarios, you’ll get a mix of advice and you will have to figure out what is applicable to you. You should always feel free to contact any of our MSTP students for advice or input - an editor of this book would happily speak with you if you reached out. If you find yourself truly unable to decide, flip a coin. If you don’t the result, pretend it landed on the other side. "],

["editors-notes.html", "Editors Notes", " Editors Notes This section is dedicated documentation for the editors of this blue book. It details the current goals and subproject that the editors are currently working on. It also describes the basic organization for oversight of this book and the workflows used by editors to produce content. Current Initiatives Develop content for our incoming class. Considering that we have incoming students that could very directly benefit from this book and it’s format, we should leverage this fact to push us to write the relevant sections and get feedback from our students as they make their transitions. Topics include: Doing an incoming summer rotation (Keshov) Saving money in graduate school (need someone) Finding a place to live (need someone) Develop content related to STEP 1 preparations. Out M2s have just recently gotten through STEP 1. Considering they have also accounted for the new policies around timing for the exam and still have prep strategies fresh in their minds, it would be wonderful to have input from our M2/G1s about how to plan and prep for STEP 1. This is an area where we need volunteers to step up, work with editors, and get some stuff written. Decide on the correct time-points for Short-Sheets. We need to make some decisions about what short-sheets (i.e. when in someone’s career) they should check-in for information. Follow-up with previous topics of interest. Choosing a mentor (Keshov and Uday) Starting a family (Laura and Catherine) Garner email advice from past years (Keshov) Workflow Background Info We use bookdown to produce this book, in its various forms, from Rmarkdown (.Rmd) files. The basic process is that Rmarkdown files (written using the Markdown syntax) are automatically compiled into an HTML website that is paginated like a book as well as an .Epub and PDF version of the book that can be downloaded from the website. Each of the chapters (except the Preface which is part of index.rmd) exists as an independent .Rmd with a number before the chapter to designate it’s order in the book. As such, level 1 headings designate a chapter and level 2 headings designate an article under a chapter. This last point is critical for content production. When new content is produced using Microsoft Word or plain text, it THE HIGHEST HEADING LEVEL SHOULD BE LEVEL 2. This ensures that when the content is converted to Markdown and pasted into the .rmd file, it shows up as an article under the correct chapter instead of a new chapter in the book. Any subheadings should be at level 3 or more to show up within the article. Pages are split at the level 1 and level 2 headings. Process of editing In a nutshell, when not simply editing the plain text of an .Rmd file for minor errors, editors will: convert a Word document of content to Markdown paste this into the correct chapter ensure links and references render correctly make sure links line up (cross-linking, etc.) ensure that the website render’s correctly push edits to the master branch It is the job of the chump-in-charge “senior” editor to review all pushes to the master branch and get approval for their integration from Alysha Taggart before accepting them. In the future, we are planning on having Alysha either create her own Github account to be the final check on this procees. Alternatively, the book in a more finalized form can be ported to the MSTP website. This is an ongoing conversation that we re-develop around May 2020. Required R Packages and System Set-Ups Install RStudio and Rmarkdown Ensure that you can use Github through RStudio or the command line. Download and install Pandoc which is a background utility used for converting between Markdown and other formats. Install Bookdown (preferably thorugh RStudio) Install DiagrammR (preferably through RStudio) Authorship As we are a bunch of academics, we technically have to provide some authorship guidelines for written work… right? Thus, the general authorship policy is as follows: Authorship is offered at the Heading 3 level for the chapters “Early Medical Years” through “Special Topics”, such that an author or authors are credited with the contents of everything under that heading. This basically means that people get credit for an “article” written under a “section” and “chapter” but we’re only crediting the chapters that contain comprehensive writing (i.e. no authorship for bullet points on a Short Sheet) Authorship is depicted with the authors name displayed in their choice of style with a hyperlink to a legitimate method of contact. Usually, this would look something like Keshov K. Sharma with the link opening to an email to the author. Twitter/Facebook links or links to Contact Me pages on a personal website are also acceptable. Authorship from a group of people is also acceptable, as long as there is at least one person who can be contacted. As such, “by The MSTP Class of 2023” with the hyperlink pointing to Keshov K. Sharma’s email is acceptable. Authorship should be granted to anyone who wrote a sizable portion of the current body text or significantly contributed to the formation of the current body text; but not to those who provided edits, suggestions, or minor corrections. If anyone really cares, authors should be lised in order of most contribution to least and, if need be, authorship and amount of contribution is decided by editors not involved in the authorship process of a particular contriubtion. As such, when articles have been significantly revised by future years, original authors can be dropped by editors to make space for those making more recent, sizable contributions to the current form of the book. Authors have the option of switching between a credited and anonamymous contribution at any time. "],
