## M1: Pre-matriculation {-}

**Please note that it is virtually impossible to list out all the things that you need to do before matriculating to the medical school. For the most part, the medical school and MSTP program will guide you through this process. Highlighted here are resources for aspects of the transition that people usually need help with and do not always have a guide for.**

### Things to Do {-}

- **Find a place to live:** [The Medical Schoolâ€™s Student-To-Student  Guide p. 34](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/MediaLibraries/URMCMedia/education/md/documents/bluebook.pdf) has a fantastic section detailing housing. Also, read our quick blurb on [a general format for finding a place to live](#very-general-guidance-on-finding-a-place-to-live).

- **Decide on a summer rotation:** Rotations in the summer before entering medical school [are optional (paragraph 1)](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/education/md-phd/students/student-handbook/curriculum/year-one.aspx). Read our section on [what to consider for an incoming rotation](#to-do-or-not-to-do;-an-incoming-rotation...) if you would like our peer perspective on this choice.

### Things to Consider {-}

- **Read the description of [Year One](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/education/md-phd/students/student-handbook/curriculum/year-one.aspx)** in the MSTP student handbook to get a general sense of what is coming at you this year.
