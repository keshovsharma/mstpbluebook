In the future, we will be housing the most recent minutes from student council in this section.

## Editors Notes {-}

This section is dedicated documentation for the editors of this blue book. It details the current goals and subproject that the editors are currently working on. It also describes the basic organization for oversight of this book and the workflows used by editors to produce content.

### Current Initiatives {-#current-inits}

**Develop content for our incoming class**. Considering that we have incoming students that could very directly benefit from this book and it's format, we should leverage this fact to push us to write the relevant sections and get feedback from our students as they make their transitions.  Topics include:

- Doing an incoming summer rotation *(Keshov)*
- Saving money in graduate school *(need someone)*
- Finding a place to live *(need someone)*

**Develop content related to STEP 1 preparations**. Out M2s have just recently gotten through STEP 1. Considering they have also accounted for the new policies around timing for the exam and still have prep strategies fresh in their minds, it would be wonderful to have input from our M2/G1s about how to plan and prep for STEP 1. **This is an area where we need volunteers to step up, work with editors, and get some stuff written**.

**Decide on the correct time-points for Short-Sheets**. We need to make some decisions about what short-sheets (i.e. when in someone's career) they should check-in for information.

**Follow-up with previous topics of interest**.

- Choosing a mentor *(Keshov and Uday)*
- Starting a family *(Laura and Catherine)*
- Garner email advice from past years *(Keshov)*

### Workflow {-}

#### Background Info {-}

We use [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) to produce this book, in its various forms, from Rmarkdown (.Rmd) files. The basic process is that Rmarkdown files (written using the [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)) are automatically compiled into an HTML website that is paginated like a book as well as an .Epub and PDF version of the book that can be downloaded from the website.

Each of the chapters (except the Preface which is part of index.rmd) exists as an independent .Rmd with a number before the chapter to designate it's order in the book. As such, level 1 headings designate a chapter and **level 2 headings designate an article under a chapter**. This last point is critical for content production.

When new content is produced using Microsoft Word or plain text, it ***THE HIGHEST HEADING LEVEL SHOULD BE LEVEL 2***. This ensures that when the content is converted to Markdown and pasted into the .rmd file, it shows up as an article under the correct chapter instead of a new chapter in the book. Any subheadings should be at level 3 or more to show up within the article. Pages are split at the level 1 and level 2 headings.

#### Process of editing {-}

In a nutshell, when not simply editing the plain text of an .Rmd file for minor errors, editors will:

- convert a Word document of content to Markdown
- paste this into the correct chapter
- ensure links and references render correctly
- make sure links line up (cross-linking, etc.)
- ensure that the website render's correctly
- push edits to the master branch

**It is the job of the ~~chump-in-charge~~ "senior" editor to review all pushes to the master branch and get approval for their integration from Alysha Taggart before accepting them.**

In the future, we are planning on having Alysha either create her own Github account to be the final check on this procees. Alternatively, the book in a more finalized form can be ported to the MSTP website. This is an ongoing conversation that we re-develop around May 2020.

#### Required R Packages and System Set-Ups {-}

- Install RStudio and Rmarkdown
- Ensure that you can use **Github** through RStudio or the command line.
- Download and install [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) which is a background utility used for converting between Markdown and other formats.
- Install Bookdown (preferably thorugh RStudio)
- Install DiagrammR (preferably through RStudio)
